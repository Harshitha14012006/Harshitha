2.Give a dictionary with value lists, sort the keys by summation of values in value list.

 Input : test_dict = {‘Gfg’ : [6, 7, 4], ‘best’ : [7, 6, 5]}

Output : {‘Gfg’: 17, ‘best’: 18}

Explanation : Sorted by sum, and replaced.

 Input : test_dict = {‘Gfg’ : [8,8], ‘best’ : [5,5]}

Output : {‘best’: 10, ‘Gfg’: 16}

Explanation : Sorted by sum, and replaced.

 Sample Input:

2

Gfg 6 7 4

Best 7 6 5

Sample Output

Gfg 17

Best 18

 



For example:

Input	Result
2
Gfg 6 7 4
Best 7 6 5
Gfg 17
Best 18

program:
def sort_dict_by_value_sum(test_dict):
    sorted_dict = {}
    sorted_keys = sorted(test_dict, key=lambda x: sum(test_dict[x]))
    for key in sorted_keys:
        sorted_dict[key] = sum(test_dict[key])
    return sorted_dict

n = int(input().strip())

input_dicts = {}

for _ in range(n):
    data = input().split()
    key = data[0]
    values = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    input_dicts[key] = values

sorted_dicts = sort_dict_by_value_sum(input_dicts)

for key, value in sorted_dicts.items():
    print(key, value)

3.In the game of Scrabble™, each letter has points associated with it. The total score of a word is the sum of the scores of its letters. More common letters are worth fewer points while less common letters are worth more points. The points associated with each letter are shown below:

Points Letters

1 A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T and U

2 D and G

3 B, C, M and P

4 F, H, V, W and Y

5 K

8 J and X

10 Q and Z

Write a program that computes and displays the Scrabble™ score for a word. Create a dictionary that maps from letters to point values. Then use the dictionary to compute the score.

A Scrabble™ board includes some squares that multiply the value of a letter or the value of an entire word. We will ignore these squares in this exercise.

Sample Input

REC

Sample Output

REC is worth 5 points.



For example:

Input	Result
REC
REC is worth 5 points.

program:
def scrabble_score(word):
    letter_values = {
        'A': 1, 'E': 1, 'I': 1, 'L': 1, 'N': 1, 'O': 1, 'R': 1, 'S': 1, 'T': 1, 'U': 1,
        'D': 2, 'G': 2,
        'B': 3, 'C': 3, 'M': 3, 'P': 3,
        'F': 4, 'H': 4, 'V': 4, 'W': 4, 'Y': 4,
        'K': 5,
        'J': 8, 'X': 8,
        'Q': 10, 'Z': 10
    }
    
    score = sum(letter_values.get(letter.upper(), 0) for letter in word)
    return f"{word} is worth {score} points."

word = input().strip()
print(scrabble_score(word))

4.A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"

Output: ["sweet","sour"]

Example 2:



Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"

Output: ["banana"]

 Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200

s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.

s1 and s2 do not have leading or trailing spaces.

All the words in s1 and s2 are separated by a single space.

Note:

Use dictionary to solve the problem


For example:

Input	Result
this apple is sweet
this apple is sour
sweet sour

Program:
def uncommon_words(s1, s2):
    word_count = {}
    for word in s1.split():
        word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1
    for word in s2.split():
        word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1
    uncommon_words = [word for word, count in word_count.items() if count == 1]
    return ' '.join(uncommon_words)

s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()

print(uncommon_words(s1, s2))

5.Given an array of names of candidates in an election. A candidate name in the array represents a vote cast to the candidate. Print the name of candidates received Max vote. If there is tie, print a lexicographically smaller name.

Examples: 

Input :  votes[] = {"john", "johnny", "jackie",

                    "johnny", "john", "jackie",

                    "jamie", "jamie", "john",

                    "johnny", "jamie", "johnny",

                    "john"};

Output : John

We have four Candidates with name as 'John', 'Johnny', 'jamie', 'jackie'. The candidates John and Johny get maximum votes. Since John is alphabetically smaller, we print it. Use dictionary to solve the above problem

 

Sample Input:

10

John

John

Johny

Jamie

Jamie

Johny

Jack

Johny

Johny

Jackie

 

Sample Output:

Johny

 program:
def find_winner(votes):
    vote_count = {}
    for candidate in votes:
        if candidate in vote_count:
            vote_count[candidate] += 1
        else:
            vote_count[candidate] = 1
    max_votes = max(vote_count.values())
    winners = [candidate for candidate, votes in vote_count.items() if votes == max_votes]
    return min(winners)

n = int(input().strip())
votes = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
print(find_winner(votes))
